#+STARTUP: showall
#+TITLE: Tecgraf libraries (IUP, CD and IM) as Common Lisp ASDF System

This system includes a shell script, ~update.sh~ which downloads the
Tecgraf shared libraries for Windows and Linux and places them in
subdirectory ~libs/~. See also
https://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/en/download_tips.html

 - The shared libraries are then included in this repository.

 - The location of the shared libraries can be referenced from
   ~(asdf:system-relative-pathname "tecgraf-libs" "libs/")~.

 - On Linux, ~patchelf~ is used set the shared library rpath to
   ~$ORIGIN~ so that the interdependencies between the Tecgraf shared
   libraries can be found relative to each other.
